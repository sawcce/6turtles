# Basics

## Numeral system

6turtles uses a base 6 numeral system where each character of the word Turtle is a numeral

```
T = 0, u = 1, r = 2, t = 3, l = 4, e = 5
```
## Variables

Variables can be declared with the following syntax:

```
IDENTIFIER is value
```

The indentifier must match this specific regex : `([A-SV-Z])+`,

meaning it can contain any upper case letter except T and U

## Primitives

The two primitive types are the string and the number.

### Strings 

Strings can be declared using the following syntax:

```
IDENTIFIER is '"Turtlei1"'
```

And can only contain the characters T,u,r,t,l,e,i,1

(note that in that case you can put anything in the string that matches these characters and any quantity of them)

### Numbers

Numbers can be declared using the following syntax:

```
IDENTIFIER is Number
```

Where number is a Valid 6turtles base-6 number like ``eurl`` or ``luT``


## Complex types

### Turtle expression

A turtle expression is a way to modify a value with another

``🐢expression operand expression🐢``

The different operands are:
    - U = division
    - s = multiplication
    - the ➕ emoji = addition
    - the ➖ emoji = substraction
    - the 👎 emoji = decreases the ascii value of an entire string
    - the 👍 emoji = increases the ascii value of an entire string

so ```🐢exu🐢``` means 5 / 1
